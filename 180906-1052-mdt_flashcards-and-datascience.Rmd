# Status:

- Yesterday, _180905-1131-mdt_flashcards-and-datascience.Rmd_:
  - Got basic flashcard updates working. This allows me to maintain study statistics in Anki for flashcards under version, even as I edit the flashcard specs in YAML files and then send the updates to Anki. This had previously been a stumbling block, when editing a card's specs and then recreating the cards would result in erasing study statistics.
  - I didn't spend time on data-science studies.

- Today:
  - Primary focus should be datascience review.
  - Second focus should be filling in AFI flashcards, and study for coding interviews.
  - Third focus should be personal projects.


# Thoughts:

My priority stack has become a bit too deep. I'm simplifying and moving stuff to lower priority or to wishlists, or discarding.


# Plans:

- Data science:
  - Transfer and reorganize datascience flashcards to new YAML system under version control.
  - To get self back up to speed, review previous courses.
    - Go over lectures again, taking notes.
    - Try to move quickly on this. Focus on review.

- AFI flashcards:
  - Go over notes, moving answers into recently setup flashcards. Also find roundrobin problem lists, and resume, writing answers into flashcards.
    - Remember, **no rote memorization.** The goal of these flashcards is to pose problems requiring that I **think through the steps of each algorithm/solution/proof**.
  - Set aside time each data to drill on problems in completed flashcards.
