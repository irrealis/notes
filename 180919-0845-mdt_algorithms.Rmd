# Status:

I've been working on personal projects for the last week.

Today I'm switching to studies, focusing on algorithms.
- Last work on studies was in _180906-1052-mdt_flashcards-and-datascience_, where I focused on data science.


# Plan:

- _update_yaml_notes.py_:
  - Revise, adding new notes field _ExtraTags_. The idea is to tag some notes as "Done", or "Done-Python", and so on.
- Algorithm flashcards:
  - Tag completed Python flashcards with "Done-Python". This should make it easier to keep track completed work as I transfer from notes to flashcards.
  - Transfer work from notes to flashcards.
  - Study completed Python flashcards.


# Log:

##### 0845: Start; status/thoughts/plans.

##### 0926: Revised _update_yaml_notes.py_. Now tagging done notes.
