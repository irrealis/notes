# Status:

Finished vocab-studies round focused on 800 GRE words with high frequency. Previously studying 12+ hours/day; reducing to 2/day; changing primary focus to calculus.

# Thinking...

I've written some fun code lately that I'd like to capture and formalize for portfolio use, including:
- Scraping ets.org essay-topic pools, identifying clusters of highly similar topics; will focus on large clusters as I practice writing essays --- such topics may be more likely to appear in tests (assuming approximately uniform distribution).
- Scraping vocabulary definitions from OED, Google, Vocab.com.
- Parsing and analyzing vocabulary etymology.
- Managing Anki flash cards defined in YAML.

Would also like to work more on deterministic software containers via Bazel/Gitian/Docker/Kubernetes/SCIF.

Above is lower priority than studying.
