# Status:

Several days since switching to personal tasks. Today, continuing work on personal tasks, and also resuming:
- Work on updating Anki flashcards.
- Datascience studies.


# Thoughts:

- As top priorities, I'm going to split my time three ways, with the goal of:
  - 1/3 time spent on flashcards.
  - 1/3 time spent on studies.
  - 1/3 time spent on personal projects.

- There are a number of skills I'd like to refresh/maintain. This will have to be an ongoing background project.
  - GPU programming:
    - OpenCL.
      - Would like to also work on latest version, with C++ interface.
    - Would like to bring Vulkan up to speed.
  - Photogrammetry.
  - Kinect Fusion.
  - Artificial life.
    - Avida platform.
  - Bioinformatics.
  - Rails frontend/API; backend logic; Python-mediated backend computation.
  - Realtime pipeline in C++.
  - ROS
  - Qt GUI work.
  - macOS app work.
  - Android app work.
  - iOS app work.
  - Linear algebra.
  - Advanced calculus.
  - Abstract algebra.
  - Probability.
  - Languages:
    - French
    - Spanish
    - German
    - Latin


# Plan:

- Flashcards:
  - From _180827-1444-mdt_:
    - Use `yaml.load(...)` to obtain Python representation of YAML file.
      - Use this data, together with existing system in _add_yaml_notes.py_, to check note specs in file.
        - If any note is missing "`id`" field, we switch modes.
          - In this case, we'll also now record the returned note ID, and generate a new version of the input file.
        - Otherwise, we simply use this data to update existing note.
    - If any note is missing "`id`" field, we switch modes.
      - Load file a second time, this time using `yaml.compose(...)`, obtaining nodes.
      - Extract the "`notes`" node.
        - For each note:
          - Extract its node.
          - Convert note node to YAML, then to Python representation.
          - If ID node is already present:
            - Based on previous work in _add_yaml_notes.py_, we convert this representation, and send to Anki as update.
            - This will use defaults from the originally-parsed Python representation for the full file.
          - If ID node not present:
            - Based on previous work in _add_yaml_notes.py_, we convert this representation, send to Anki as new note, and record the returned note ID.
            - This will use defaults from the originally-parsed Python representation for the full file.
            - Modify the note node, adding to it a new ID node.
      - Use `yaml.serialize(...)` on nodes, generating new version of file.
      - Save new version of file.

- Datascience:
  - Transfer and reorganize datascience flashcards to new YAML system under version control.
  - To get self back up to speed, review previous courses.
    - Go over lectures again, taking notes.
    - Try to move quickly on this. Focus on review.
