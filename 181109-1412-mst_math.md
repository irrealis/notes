# Status:

Finished vocab-studies round focused on 800 GRE words with high frequency. Previously studying 12+ hours/day; reducing to 2/day; changing primary focus to calculus.

# Thinking...

I've written some fun code lately that I'd like to capture and formalize for portfolio use, including:
- Scraping ets.org essay-topic pools, identifying clusters of highly similar topics; will focus on large clusters as I practice writing essays --- such topics may be more likely to appear in tests (assuming approximately uniform distribution).
- Scraping vocabulary definitions from OED, Google, Vocab.com.
- Parsing and analyzing vocabulary etymology.
- Managing Anki flash cards defined in YAML.

Would also like to work more on deterministic software containers via Bazel/Gitian/Docker/Kubernetes/SCIF.

Above is lower priority than studying.


# Plans:

Focus next two weeks creating flashcards for math problems. Spend two hours per day on vocabulary.

Math, focusing on Stewart calculus text:
- Per-chapter paper notes, in book folder. Keep succinct.
  - For now only listing skipped chapters and sections, and reasons for skipping.
  - May later want more detailed notes.
- Generally, focus on typesetting exercises with answers (odd-numbered problems). As needed, detailed reads of chapter contents and examples, but no more than needed. Goal is to move quickly.
- Review each chapter. Any I can skip wholesale?
  - Take note of skipped chapters; may later discover I need to study skipped chapters.
- Per-chapter:
  - Review each sections.
  - Any I can skip wholesale?
    - If so, assume can also skip related problems.
    - Take note of skipped sections; may later discover I need to study skipped sections.
  - For not-skipped sections, load relevant problems into flashcards.
