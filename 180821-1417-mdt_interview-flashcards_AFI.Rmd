# Status:

- _180820-1129-mdt_interview-flashcards.Rmd_:
  - Modified _add_yaml_notes.py_ to allow more default parameters, namely: default fields.
    - Now, by default, my coding flashcards have sections "Python", "C++", and "Java" all reading "To-do".
  - Updated flashcards to use default fields.
    - This greatly reduces repetitive card specs, and hence makes the card specs much shorter.
    - Card specs will grow as I complete the coding exercises in thee above fields.
  - Completed flashcard fronts for AFI chapter 4.


# Plans:

- To around 1500h--1530h: setup and begin work on interview flashcards for AFI chapter 5.
- Stop at around 1500h--1530h to run personal errands.
