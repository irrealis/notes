  - Finish _Math/Textbooks/Calculus/Calculus-ConceptsAndContexts/01-7.yml_.
  - Continue setting up math flashcards.


# Plans:

As last Tuesday: math, focusing on Stewart calculus text:
- Per-chapter paper notes, in book folder. Keep succinct.
  - For now only listing skipped chapters and sections, and reasons for skipping.
  - May later want more detailed notes.
- Generally, focus on typesetting exercises with answers (odd-numbered problems). As needed, detailed reads of chapter contents and examples, but no more than needed. Goal is to move quickly.
- Review each chapter. Any I can skip wholesale?
  - Take note of skipped chapters; may later discover I need to study skipped chapters.
- Per-chapter:
  - Review each sections.
  - Any I can skip wholesale?
    - If so, assume can also skip related problems.
    - Take note of skipped sections; may later discover I need to study skipped sections.
  - For not-skipped sections, load relevant problems into flashcards.
