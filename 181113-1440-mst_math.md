# Status:

- Friday and Monday:
  - Troubleshot crashing macOS VM.
    - Upgraded VirtualBox.
    - Upgraded macOS VM.
    - Ran memtest on host; no errors.
    - Traced problem to not enough VRAM allocated. Increased. Solved.
- Goal for next two weeks: make math flashcards for all problems with solutions in book.


# Plan:

As on Friday: focus next two weeks creating flashcards for math problems. Spend two hours per day on vocabulary.

Math, focusing on Stewart calculus text:
- Per-chapter paper notes, in book folder. Keep succinct.
  - For now only listing skipped chapters and sections, and reasons for skipping.
  - May later want more detailed notes.
- Generally, focus on typesetting exercises with answers (odd-numbered problems). As needed, detailed reads of chapter contents and examples, but no more than needed. Goal is to move quickly.
- Review each chapter. Any I can skip wholesale?
  - Take note of skipped chapters; may later discover I need to study skipped chapters.
- Per-chapter:
  - Review each sections.
  - Any I can skip wholesale?
    - If so, assume can also skip related problems.
    - Take note of skipped sections; may later discover I need to study skipped sections.
  - For not-skipped sections, load relevant problems into flashcards.


# Thinking:

No fun during days for next two weeks. Save fun for evenings. Only math. Exception: Thanksgiving.
