# Status:

- _180816-1242-mdt_inteview-flashcards.Rmd_:
  - Modified _add_yaml_notes.py_ to allow per-note overrides of default parameters.
    - For example, most of my recent interview flashcards are coding exercises, but one posed a general question about sorting algorithms, so needed to be of a different type.
    - I can now include both questions in the same file, generally using a "coding" flashcard type, but using a "typesetting" type for the exception mentioned above.
  - Completed flashcard questions for AFI chapter 3.
  - Began flashcard questions for AFI chapter 4.


# Plans:

- Spend about three hours on interview flashcards.
- Stop at 15:30 to run errands.


# Thoughts:

- Studies:
  - Once I'm done with flashcard fronts for AFI:
    - Write flashcards for my recent general work in data structures and algorithms. Fronts and backs.
    - Drill on recent general work in data structures and algorithms.
    - Switch back to AFI flashcards, filling in cards whose questions I've recently solved.
    - Then begin working through questions I haven't yet solved.
    - Alternate with drills on solved AFI flashcards.
      - Try doing some of these at the whiteboard while recording with camera.
      - Playback and analyze.
  - I may want to periodically switch to other tasks:
    - Math flashcards.
    - Math drills.
    - Personal tasks.
