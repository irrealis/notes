# Status:

- _180906-1052-mdt_flashcards-and-datascience_:
  - Reviewing notes from data science courses on Coursera.
    - Data-Science track by Johns Hopkins University.
    - Began review of course "The Data Scientist's Toolbox" (TDST). Abandoned detailed review after determining this course is primarily an overview of the remainder of the track. Thoughts/plans:
      - Defer detailed review until after reviewing all other completed courses, and completing remaining courses.
      - There will probably be some material in TDST that is not covered in other courses. Some of this may be basic preparatory material that I need not cover (e.g., command-line interface overview; Git overview; Markdown overview). Some more-interesting material (e.g., alternative names for various binary-classification probabilities) may or may not be covered in courses I haven't yet taken.
    - Switched to review of second course "R Programming" (RP).
      - Working on week-1 material. I think I may have most of this material covered both in notes and in flashcards (old set, deck _Root::Data Science::02 - R Programming_). I've been material from this deck into the new version-controlled YAML spec files.
- In recent reprioritization, I'd decided to split my time three ways:
  - 1/3 time spent on flashcards.
  - 1/3 time spent on studies.
  - 1/3 time spent on personal projects.

  There's more work to be done on flashcards --- cleanup, refactoring; see _180905-1131-mdt_flashcards-and-datascience_, timestamp _1856_ --- but this is not high-priority work.

  I'll spend the first part of today on personal projects, and depending on how that goes, I may switch to data science studies.
