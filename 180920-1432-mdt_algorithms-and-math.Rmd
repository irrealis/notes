# Status:

- Two days ago on 180918:
  - CCAC (Calculus: Concepts & Contexts): calculus diagnostic problems 00.A 01 and 02. Mostly I was setting up for upcoming work.
- Yesterday, _180919-0845-mdt_algorithms_:
  - Flashcard system:
    - Added new notes field `ExtraTags`. I'm using this to mark notes as "Done", or coding notes as "Done-Python" and so on.
  - AFI problems:
    - 01.02: Search a sorted array for \(k\)
    - 01.08: Anagrams
    - 01.09: Search for a pair which sums to \(S\)
    - 01.16: Search BST for a key
    - 01.17: Search BST for \(x > k\)
    - 02.01 Good sorting algorithms
    - 02.10: Merging sorted arrays
  - CCAC problems:
    - RoA (Review of Algebra): created section for upcoming work.

I'm going to need to switch back to personal projects soon, and I also want to work some more on data-science reviews before I start the next data-science course.

Before I do that, though, I want to get a better feel for how quickly I can work on each topic. So I'll be taking more detailed notes that include some info about how long each problem takes.


# Plans:

- Commit some work on data-science flashcards.
- Start with RoA laws/theorems flashcards; don't worry about timing.
- Then typeset RoA problem flashcards, tracking time spent per flashcard. Don't typeset solutions yet.
- Solve each problem on paper, tracking time spent per problem. Don't typeset solutions yet.
- Once all solutions written, start typesetting each solution, tracking time spent per solution.

I may not have much time today, as I have some personal things to attend to.

- If I have time, switch to practicing flashcards.
- If I still have time, plan next steps.
